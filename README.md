# About

This project is in progress. It uses React, is built with hooks. It incorporates a free API - PokéAPI. It also uses Material-UI. In short, it is a simple memory game. The goal is to click on each Pokemon in a round one time, remembering which ones you have and have not clicked. As you click each new Pokemon, it will count your running score and your highest score yet. When you click on a Pokemon you clicked before, the current score counter will reset. A project in progress, it currently does most of this, but will have a series of 4 rounds with increasing numbers of Pokemon. The number of Pokemon in the in-progress version is limited to speed up hot reloading and reduce the number of API calls. The final version will also include instructions to players in a modal window and will give a notification when you have cycled through all of the Pokemon to win the game. It does not yet incorporate Prettier to enforce clean code standards (otherwise a single character can stop it from compiling and that annoys me).

You can see a working version [here](https://carldoleolundgren.github.io/pokemon-memory-game/), with the big caveat that it is NOT complete. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
